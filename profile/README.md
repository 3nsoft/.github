# Building the future.

Our team is creating an uncompromisingly user-centric digital space:
 - [3NWeb](https://github.com/PrivacySafe/3NWeb-architecture) is a collection of protocols, formats and APIs that set the digital stage.
 - [PrivacySafe](https://github.com/PrivacySafe/privacysafe-platform-electron) is an implementation of client-side platform.

If you want to use PrivacySafe now, you can download the platform packed with basic 3NWeb apps [here](https://3nweb.com/downloads/PrivacySafe/). Note that at this time only nightly/pre-release versions are available. Regular stable service will come with the first stable release.

If you want to help us with development of protocols and open source goodies, go to [PrivacySafe open collective page](https://opencollective.com/privacysafe).

If you want to run your own 3NWeb service, you can build it from [spec-server source](https://github.com/PrivacySafe/spec-server), or use [spec-3nweb-server npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spec-3nweb-server) in your own code.

If you want to make user-facing 3NWeb apps, check out in [platform bundle downloads](https://3nweb.com/downloads/PrivacySafe/)  "platform-test-apps" for an example of using a test stand mode and "platform-api-ts-d" for definitions of injected 3NWeb capabilities.

If you want to implement your own 3NWeb server or client side platform, check out related test suites in [spec-server](https://github.com/PrivacySafe/spec-server/tree/master/ts-code/tests/protocols) and [PrivacySafe](https://github.com/PrivacySafe/privacysafe-platform-electron/tree/main/platform-tester-apps). These test suites will become a part of respective 3NWeb standards.
